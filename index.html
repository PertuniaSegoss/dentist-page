        <p>
          Hi, I'm Dr Nontokozo Pretty Thabethe a dentist, ortho enthusiast and
          advocate for gentle anxiety-free dental care.<br />
          <br />
          Graduated (BDS, 2022), now diving into a Postgrad Diploma in
          Interactive Orthodonontics.<br />
          <br />
          When I'm not creating confident smiles, I'm probably trying to finish
          a book or make it to the gym. <br />
          <br />
          My journey into dentistry began with childhood dental fears - which
          inspired me to make dental visits a more comfortable, positive
          experience for others. I'm all about gentle care and helping patients
          overcome dental anxiety.

      <h2>What Our Patients Say</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "I recently visited ASA Dentistry for a full dental check-up and
        cleaning, and I can confidently say it was one of the best dental
        experiences I’ve ever had. From the moment I walked in, the staff was
        warm, welcoming, and very patient. The reception area was spotless and
        calming, which really helped ease my nerves. Dr. Asa took the time to
        explain every step of the process to me, making sure I understood what
        was happening and why. I appreciated how gentle they were throughout the
        cleaning — no rushing, no discomfort, and no judgment.
        <br />
        <br />
        What stood out the most is the level of professionalism and care. They
        genuinely listened to my concerns and recommended treatment options
        without trying to upsell anything unnecessary. I left feeling more
        confident about my dental health and the work they do. My smile looks
        and feels so much better now. I’m extremely grateful to have found a
        dentist that truly prioritizes patient comfort and satisfaction. I will
        definitely be returning and recommending ASA Dentistry to my family and
        friends! "
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "I brought my daughter to ASA Dentistry for her first dental
        appointment, and the experience exceeded every expectation I had. My
        daughter is usually very anxious about medical visits, but the dentist
        and the entire team handled her with such kindness and care. They
        explained everything in child-friendly language, allowed her to ask
        questions, and even made her laugh — something I didn’t think was
        possible at a dentist!
        <br />
        <br />
        The clinic is very clean, modern, and well-organized. The dentist was
        incredibly patient and didn’t rush the appointment at all. They took
        detailed X-rays, thoroughly examined her teeth, and gave us helpful
        advice about dental hygiene for children. What I loved most is that they
        focused on teaching, not just treating. By the time we left, my daughter
        was smiling and proudly holding her new toothbrush.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m honestly relieved to have found a dental practice that provides both
        excellent medical care and a comforting environment. We will definitely
        be returning for all future appointments. Highly recommended for both
        adults and children! "
